## Product Identity

DevBits is where developers document real progress, not vanity metrics.

- `Streams` are projects.
- `Bytes` are project updates.
- `Bits` are comments and conversations.

Anyone can react, follow, comment, and join the conversation.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> DevBits is designed for technical storytelling: milestones, blockers, experiments, demos, and lessons learned.

## Project Story

DevBits exists to make technical progress visible.

Instead of posting polished outcomes only, builders can share:

- What they are building now
- What broke today
- What they learned while fixing it
- What they are shipping next

> [!TIP]
> The goal is simple: give developers a social home for real work in progress.
